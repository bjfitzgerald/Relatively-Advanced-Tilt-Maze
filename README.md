Assignment Name: Programming Assignment 1, Part II

# A. Required Elements
* Use either the arrow keys or 'WASD' to tilt the board
* Hit 'Q' or ESC to quit
* Hit 'R' to restart
* Press 'Space' to jump the ball
* Collect at least two pink pick-up cubes then head to the green circle to win
* Falling off the board will lose the game
* The inner maze walls turn at random, so watch out!

# B. Additional Elements
* Changed the particle system so that it always emits upwards

# C. Known Issues
* It is possible for pick-ups to be randomly assigned to the same board location (they will not spawn on the goal or in the center). Since the spec did not address overlapping pick-ups, this might not be an 'issue' per se, but certainly something to be aware of.
